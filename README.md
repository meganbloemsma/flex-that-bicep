# ðŸ’ªFlex that bicep

These are my notes I made when I was learning to work with Azure bicep. Before starting I was aware of the concept of infrastructure-as-code, but never worked with it before. So these notes are for everyone!

The [src](https://github.com/meganbloemsma/flex-that-bicep/blob/main/src/) folder contains my code from the MSFT learn bicep courses.

You can find the official documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/).

I highly recommend getting your hands dirty and experimenting. [For example, with this exercise](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/single-database-create-bicep-quickstart?view=azuresql&tabs=CLI).
